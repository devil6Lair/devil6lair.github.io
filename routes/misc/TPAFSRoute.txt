== Timing == 
Timer starts on this screen when you press A 'Complete' http://i.imgur.com/q2Thy9Q.jpg (No -9.40/-9.27 delay) Also keep in mind that it's a file that did BiT and saved. So Link will start by the Faron spring right before the lantern.
Timer ends when you say Yes to Midna leaving Lakebed Temple.
